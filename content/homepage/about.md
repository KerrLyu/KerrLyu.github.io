## Self Introduction

I am currently in my fourth year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). My primary research interests include entrepreneurship, labor economics, and health economics. I have a broad interest in both developed and developing countries, especially in the area of self-employment.

Prior to joining UNR, I earned an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh in the UK.
