## Self Introduction

I am currently in my fifth year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), with plans to enter the job market in the 2025-2026 academic year. Prior to joining UNR, I earned an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. Two key questions drive my research:

❓What drives self-employment? Is it primarily dominated and driven by opportunity or by necessity in both high- and middle-income countries?

❓To what extent can policies designed to promote self-employment effectively enhance social welfare?

These questions shape my primary research interests in entrepreneurship, labor economics, and health economics, with a particular focus on solo self-employment, also known as nonemployer businesses.

I have taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate-level courses as an instructor and am passionate about fostering an active, dynamic, and inclusive learning environment where students can connect theory with real-world challenges.
