## Self Introduction

I am currently in my fourth year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), with plans to enter the job market in the 2024-2025 academic year. My primary research interests are in entrepreneurship, labor economics, and health economics, with a particular focus on self-employment in both developed and developing countries. Prior to joining UNR, I earned an MSc in Economics from the University of Edinburgh in the UK.
