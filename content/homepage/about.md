## Self Introduction

I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), **currently on the job market for the 2025–2026 academic year**. 

My research fields are **Labor Economics**, **Economics of Entrepreneurship**, **Public Economics**, and **Health Economics**. Broadly, my research examines how public policies and individual factors shape entrepreneurial activity, particularly among “fragile” or early-stage ventures such as solo self-employment, nonemployer firms, and unincorporated businesses. Two key questions drive my research: 

❓What drives self-employment? Is it primarily dominated and driven by opportunity or by necessity in both high- and middle-income countries?

❓To what extent can policies designed to promote self-employment effectively enhance social welfare?

I have taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate-level courses as an instructor and am passionate about fostering an active, dynamic, and inclusive learning environment where students can connect theory with real-world challenges.
