### Game Insturctions


1. Divide the class into several groups with one student per group.
2. Distribute a Job Market Bingo card and a set of tokens to each student.
3. Explain the rules of the game: The instructor will act as the "caller" and draw a caller card containing a
job-related factor or consequence. Students will listen for a match on their bingo card and place a token
on the corresponding square if it is present. The objective is to get five tokens in a row (vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally) to win.

### Gameplay

1. Begin calling out factors and consequences from the caller cards, giving students 2 minites to find and
mark the matching squares on their bingo cards.
2. Continue calling until a student gets five tokens in a row and shouts "Bingo!"
3. Verify the winning card by reviewing the marked squares and their corresponding caller cards.
4. Optionally, winner will have two extra credits.
