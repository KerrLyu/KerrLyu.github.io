{{< collapse summary="Abstract">}}
Risky health behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, not only lead to preventable deaths but also affect workplace performance. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study examines how these behaviors influence the choice between solo self-employment, employer entrepreneurship, and paid employment. The study employs the instrumental variable approach, using cigarette and alcohol prices as instruments. The findings reveal that increased smoking and drinking behaviors reduce the likelihood of choosing self-employment, regardless of its type. Two primary channels of influence emerge from the analysis: the 'individual channel,' which indicates that such behaviors adversely affect health and decrease the likelihood of becoming an employer, and the 'group addiction channel,' which suggests that these behaviors boost social capital, thereby increasing the chances of business ownership.{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse summary="Abstract">}}
 This paper investigates the impact of minimum wage increases on non-employer business establishments at the county level in the United States. Using a two-way fixed effects analysis and an identification strategy that compares non-employer establishments in contiguous counties across neighboring states, we examine the effects of minimum wages. Our analysis employs data from the Nonemployer Statistics provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, spanning from 2001 to 2020. The findings indicate that increases in the minimum wage reduce the number of non-employer business establishments, with a 1\% rise in the minimum wage leading to a 0.8\% decrease in the number of businesses. Further insights using data from the Business Formation Statistics, Business Dynamics Statistics, the Current Population Survey, and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages reveal that higher minimum wages discourage transitions from non-employer to employer status, do not significantly affect the shift between wage employment and self-employment, and promote transitions from self-employment to unemployment. This negative effect is mitigated in counties with a more disadvantaged labor force, characterized by higher percentages of females, Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and lower percentages of high school graduates. Conversely, this effect becomes positive in the transportation industry, likely due to the gig economy. These results are robust across various variables, models, and datasets.{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse summary="Abstract">}}
 Achieving Net-Zero Emissions Goals within enterprises is critical to advancing sustainable development objectives. This study utilizes the establishment of the Green Financial Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone (GFRI) as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the impact of green finance on corporate carbon emissions, drawing on data from Chinese listed companies over the period 2013-2022. The analysis confirms that the implementation of GFRI has a significant negative effect on corporate carbon emissions, a finding that remains consistent across various robustness tests. Furthermore, this study also explores regional and sectoral heterogeneity, highlighting that the carbon reduction impact of GFRI is more pronounced in the eastern and middle regions, manufacturing enterprises. Regarding the mechanism of action, this study adopts a dual-stage value chain perspective to explore that the promotion of GFRI reduce carbon emissions by enhancing corporate green innovation efficiency, and primarily facilitating efficiency of transforming green outcomes. This study provides a clear elucidation of the causal relationship between green finance and carbon emissions, and offers empirical evidence to support the role of green finance in promoting corporate carbon emissions mitigation.{{< /collapse >}}
