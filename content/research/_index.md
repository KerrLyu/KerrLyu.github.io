1. **Xiuli L., Xinchi J., Lyu K., Pibin G., and Jun S.. (2023).** The impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on urban energy transition: an analysis of multiple mediating effects based on “government- enterprise-resident”. Unpublished. [Abstract](The Low-Carbon City Pilot (LCCP) policy is a significant project in energy transition which is a critical global task due to concerns about energy security and climate
change. However, few studies have focused on the spatial spillover effects and mechanism role of LCCP policy on energy transition. To address this gap, this study employs a sample dataset comprising 277 cities from 2006 to 2020 and adopts Spatial Difference-In-Differences (SDID) model to explore this key spatial spillover effect exhibited by pilot cities. In addition, this study establishes a spatial mediation effect model to analyze the mechanism from the perspective of factor agglomeration and further analyze the heterogeneity in different kinds of cities. Empirical evidence reveals
that the LCCP policy promotes urban energy transition in the region, but generates negative spatial spillovers to neighboring cities, a result that remains robust even under rigorous testing. Mechanism analysis identifies three pathways for urban energy transition promotion: capital aggregation, technology aggregation, and industry aggregation. Heterogeneity analysis shows the LCCP policy has different effects in eastern cities, resource-based cities, as well as first and second-tier cities. The research can offer valuable policy recommendations aimed at comprehensively
promoting the progress of low-carbon cities and accelerating the ongoing energy transition process worldwide.)

(2023).** Towards sustainable development: The spatial spillover effects of low-carbon city pilot policy on urban energy transition. Unpublished. [Abstract](The global energy transition is crucial for all nations due to increasing concerns about energy security and climate change. The low-carbon city pilot  (LCCP) policy is an essential project in the energy transition process, but its impact on urban energy transition (ET) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this, we use a multi-temporal Difference In Difference (DID) model, analyzing panel data from 277 Chinese cities spanning 2006 to 2020, to examine the effects of the LCCP policy on urban energy transition. The findings show that the LCCP policy greatly influences urban energy transition, and the findings can withstand a number of robustness tests, particularly the decomposed effects of staggered DID. Moreover, we construct a multiple mediation effect model to identify three pathways through which the policy facilitates energy transition: "LCCP→Government Intervention→ET", "LCCP→Enterprise Technology Innovation→ET", and "LCCP→Residents' Green Consumption Awareness Enhancement→ET". Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that first- and second-tier cities, resource-based cities, and eastern cities experience more substantial impacts. Our findings hold vital implications for promoting low-carbon cities and achieving sustainable energy systems.)

[Abstract](Risky health behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, not only lead to preventable deaths but also affect workplace performance. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study examines how these behaviors influence the choice between solo self-employment, employer entrepreneurship, and paid employment. The study employs the instrumental variable approach, using cigarette and alcohol prices as instruments. The findings reveal that increased smoking and drinking behaviors reduce the likelihood of choosing self-employment, regardless of its type. Two primary channels of influence emerge from the analysis: the 'individual channel,' which indicates that such behaviors adversely affect health and decrease the likelihood of becoming an employer, and the 'group addiction channel,' which suggests that these behaviors boost social capital, thereby increasing the chances of business ownership.)
