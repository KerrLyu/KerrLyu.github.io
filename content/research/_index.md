{{< collapse summary="Abstract">}}
Risky health behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, not only lead to preventable deaths but also affect workplace performance. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study examines how these behaviors influence the choice between solo self-employment, employer entrepreneurship, and paid employment. The study employs the instrumental variable approach, using cigarette and alcohol prices as instruments. The findings reveal that increased smoking and drinking behaviors reduce the likelihood of choosing self-employment, regardless of its type. Two primary channels of influence emerge from the analysis: the 'individual channel,' which indicates that such behaviors adversely affect health and decrease the likelihood of becoming an employer, and the 'group addiction channel,' which suggests that these behaviors boost social capital, thereby increasing the chances of business ownership.{{< /collapse >}}

{{< collapse summary="Abstract">}}
The global energy transition is crucial for all nations due to increasing concerns about energy security and climate change. The low-carbon city pilot  (LCCP) policy is an essential project in the energy transition process, but its impact on urban energy transition (ET) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this, we use a multi-temporal Difference In Difference (DID) model, analyzing panel data from 277 Chinese cities spanning 2006 to 2020, to examine the effects of the LCCP policy on urban energy transition. The findings show that the LCCP policy greatly influences urban energy transition, and the findings can withstand a number of robustness tests, particularly the decomposed effects of staggered DID. Moreover, we construct a multiple mediation effect model to identify three pathways through which the policy facilitates energy transition: "LCCP→Government Intervention→ET", "LCCP→Enterprise Technology Innovation→ET", and "LCCP→Residents' Green Consumption Awareness Enhancement→ET". Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that first- and second-tier cities, resource-based cities, and eastern cities experience more substantial impacts. Our findings hold vital implications for promoting low-carbon cities and achieving sustainable energy systems.{{< /collapse >}}
