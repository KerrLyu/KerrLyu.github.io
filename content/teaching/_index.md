As instructor for Principles of Macroeconomics and Economic Statistics, I use interactive tools like Mentimeter and Top Hat to bridge theory with real-world analysis. Students engage through policy simulations and collaborative projects analyzing datasets like FRED unemployment trends. These activities build job-ready skills in data interpretation and evidence-based decision-making.
