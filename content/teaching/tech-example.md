## Teaching with Technology: Real-Time Polling with Mentimeter

In my *Principles of Macroeconomics* class, I integrated **Mentimeter** across the semester to build a more interactive and engaging classroom experience. This three-part approach included a pre-course survey, real-time knowledge checks, and reflection activities through word clouds.

### Part 1: Pre-class Survey to Understand Student Preferences

Before the course began, I surveyed students on their preferred learning formats and macroeconomic interests. This allowed me to adjust the structure and content of the course to better match their preferences.

*Insight:* Most students preferred lecture-based delivery and game-based learning over discussions. This insight helped shape my lesson planning and use of classroom activities.

### Part 2: Knowledge Checks and Live Polling

To introduce key macroeconomic topics and assess understanding, I used Mentimeter’s live multiple-choice and ranking features. This promoted active participation and enabled me to clarify misconceptions immediately.

  <img src="/jpg/Mentimeter_example_Page_4.jpg" alt="GDP Trend Poll" width="48%">
</div>

*Example Questions:*
- “Rank the top 6 U.S. government spending categories in 2022.”
- “The proportion of U.S. GDP to the world’s GDP since 1960?”

These live polls sparked engagement and led to rich in-class discussions.

### Part 3: Reflection and Discussion Using Word Clouds

Toward the end of class, I used Mentimeter’s word cloud function to facilitate reflection and discussion. This gave students the freedom to express ideas anonymously and creatively.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;">
  <img src="/jpg/Mentimeter_example_Page_2.jpg" alt="Inflation Word Cloud" width="48%">
  <img src="/jpg/Mentimeter_example_Page_5.jpg" alt="Scarcity Word Cloud" width="48%">
</div>

*Example Prompts:*
- “Guess the U.S. inflation rate in 2021.”
- “Which resources do you think are scarce?”

The responses served as a springboard for deeper conversations around economic perceptions and behavioral responses.

### Summary of Impact

Mentimeter helped transform my lectures into dynamic learning experiences by:
- Allowing anonymous student engagement
- Surfacing misconceptions in real time
- Enabling data-informed teaching adjustments

Going forward, I plan to expand this integration into group competitions, concept reviews, and semester-long learning tracking.
