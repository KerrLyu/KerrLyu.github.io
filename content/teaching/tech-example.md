## 🎓 Teaching with Technology: A Classroom Game Example

In my *Principles of Macroeconomics* course, I integrated live, tech-enhanced simulations to teach complex economic concepts like **supply and demand** in an engaging and interactive way.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Make abstract economic concepts tangible by turning the classroom into a live marketplace using collaborative tools and real-time visual feedback.

---

### 🛠 Tools Used

- **Google Sheets** with live graphs
- **Mobile devices** and QR codes
- **GitHub-hosted game interface**
- **Projector for real-time visualization**

---

### 🎮 Activity: *Supply and Demand Market Game*

Students are randomly assigned as **buyers** or **sellers**. Using mobile devices, they input offers into a shared Google Sheet, which instantly updates a **live demand-supply graph**.
