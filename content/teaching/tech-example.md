## 📊 Teaching with Technology: Real-Time Polling with Mentimeter

In my *Principles of Macroeconomics* class, I incorporated **Mentimeter** throughout the course to build a more engaging, data-informed classroom. This three-part integration helped me better understand student preferences, reinforce knowledge in real time, and foster discussion.

### 🧩 Part 1: Pre-class Survey to Understand Student Interest

Before the course began, I asked students to share their preferred learning formats and macroeconomic topics. This allowed me to tailor lecture formats and examples accordingly.

*📌 Insight:* Students overwhelmingly favored lectures and interactive games over discussions. This shaped how I structured both the content flow and assessments.

### 💡 Part 2: Live Interaction During Class

Mentimeter questions were used to introduce new topics and conduct live concept checks. This kept students engaged and made abstract macroeconomic ideas more concrete.

</div>

*📌 Example Polls:*  
- "The proportion of US GDP to the world’s GDP since 1960?"  
- "Rank the top 6 U.S. government spending categories."

These sparked immediate conversation and allowed me to explain why certain answers were correct or surprising.

### 🌐 Part 3: Reflection & Discussion via Word Cloud

Toward the end of class, I used word clouds to let students share takeaways or respond to reflective prompts anonymously.

*📌 Discussion Prompt:* “Which resources do you think are scarce?”  
Students brought up both textbook answers (e.g., oil, food, water) and creative or unexpected entries (e.g., toilet paper, good women), which created space for humor and deeper debate.

### 📈 Summary of Impact

Mentimeter transformed my large lectures into dynamic, interactive experiences by:
- Empowering quiet students to participate anonymously
- Revealing misconceptions in real time
- Making data-driven decisions about teaching format and topic pacing

I plan to expand its use for **group competitions**, **pre-exam reviews**, and **longitudinal tracking** of learning progress in future semesters.
