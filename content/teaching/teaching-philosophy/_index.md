## üí° Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment where students actively apply economic concepts to real-world contexts.

My teaching philosophy centers on:

- **Active learning**: games, simulations, and experiments
- **Clarity and accessibility**: breaking down complex topics
- **Encouraging curiosity**: asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and exploring beyond formulas
- **Feedback-focused teaching**: formative assessments that guide students

This approach supports a deeper, more lasting understanding and prepares students for practical, data-driven decision-making.
