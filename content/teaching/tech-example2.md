## Teaching with Technology: Zoom-Based Modeling and Forecasting with Real U.S. Data

To enhance data analysis skills in Intermediate Macroeconomics, I delivered a Zoom-based workshop that taught students how to model, interpret, and forecast U.S. economic performance using real-world macroeconomic indicators.

### 1. The Plan: Bridging Theory and Application

Many students understand growth theory abstractly but struggle to connect it with actual economic data. My objective was to close this gap by:
- Introducing students to **exponential growth models**, **regression-based forecasting**, and **growth accounting**,
- Using **real U.S. GDP, capital, and employment data** from 1948–2023,
- Making students apply these models themselves using Excel during a live Zoom session.

This approach targeted the learning outcomes of:
- Understanding long-run growth patterns;
- Using macroeconomic models to interpret real-world policy contexts;
- Applying basic econometrics.

### 2. Implementation via Zoom

During a live Zoom session:
- I shared my screen while walking through the **GDP trend analysis using exponential and polynomial models**,
- Students followed along in an Excel file I distributed beforehand,
- I introduced how to linearize the exponential model using natural logs and walked them through **regression estimation** inside Excel,
- We discussed the interpretation of coefficients and forecast accuracy using **U.S. real GDP** and **growth rates**.

Here is a screenshot of the Excel visualization shared with students:

### 3. Outcomes and Reflection

Students reported higher confidence in applying theory to data. In follow-up surveys:
- Over 80% said this session helped them better understand the link between models and macroeconomic realities;
- Several included model-based forecasts in their final course projects.

**What worked well:**
- The step-by-step walkthroughs with screen sharing;
- Real-time Excel edits allowed students to immediately test model changes;
- Interactive discussion via Zoom chat on regression interpretation.

**Challenges:**
- A few students had difficulty replicating Excel regressions due to software version differences;
- Some Zoom connection issues slightly disrupted continuity.

**Future Plans:**
- I plan to prerecord these modules to allow students to pause and rewind;
- I’ll also offer template files with embedded formulas to lower technical barriers;
- For assessment, I plan to build a companion quiz inside Canvas that checks model comprehension.
