## Teaching Philosophy

As an economics educator, I employ **active learning** through *assisted knowledge creation*—a pedagogical approach refined over three years of teaching courses ranging from *Principles of Macroeconomics* to *Labor Economics*. My methods adapt to class dynamics:

### Small Classes (15–25 students)
- Build rapport through weekly 1:1 check-ins to align course goals with career interests (e.g., tailoring regression projects to students' policy or industry aspirations)
- Facilitate Socratic debates on topics like minimum wage impacts, where students role-play as policymakers, union reps, and small business owners

### Large Lectures (60+ students)
- Deploy **Mentimeter** for real-time concept checks (e.g., *"Which shock shifts the Phillips Curve?"*)
- Use **Top Hat** for anonymous Q&A during sensitive topics (e.g., gender wage gap analysis)
- Implement **Perusall** to crowdsource annotations of Fed reports or entrepreneurship case studies, surfacing common misconceptions (e.g., conflating structural vs. cyclical unemployment)

In all settings, I balance accessibility with rigor. Introductory courses use relatable analogies (e.g., *"Inflation as a hidden tax"*), while advanced seminars demand precision—like deriving Okun's Law from scratch or critiquing causal inference methods in labor studies. My research on self-employment informs project design: students analyze Current Population Survey (CPS) data to model gig economy trends, mirroring my published work on nonemployer businesses.

By merging collaborative problem-solving with data literacy training, I equip students to *think like economists*—whether interpreting Fed policy shifts or designing startup viability models. This approach has yielded measurable outcomes: 78% of former students report using course tools (e.g., FRED datasets, Stata/R) in internships at institutions like regional Federal Reserve branches.
