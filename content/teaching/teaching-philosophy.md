## Teaching Philosophy

As an economics educator, I see teaching as a collaborative process of discovery, where students learn to think critically, solve problems with data, and engage with real-world policy questions. I leverage **technology intentionally** to enhance this process—transforming lectures into interactive spaces and assignments into hands-on learning experiences.

I regularly integrate digital platforms to foster **active participation**. Tools like **Mentimeter** and **Top Hat** allow for real-time polling, anonymous Q&A, and live problem-solving. During lessons on inflation or unemployment, I use these tools to pose questions such as *“Which shock shifts the Phillips Curve?”* or *“How would you classify today’s labor market?”*—stimulating immediate reflection and peer comparison. These real-time checks help me adjust pacing and ensure that no one falls behind.

To encourage **collaborative learning**, I employ **Perusall** for group annotation of readings, including Federal Reserve reports and case studies on economic development. Students highlight confusing sections, respond to each other’s questions, and develop shared insights before class discussions. This not only boosts engagement with primary materials but also prepares students to debate policy tradeoffs with confidence.

I also use **Canvas-integrated resources** like *MyLab* and *McGraw-Hill Connect* for adaptive assignments that reinforce course concepts outside the classroom. These platforms offer algorithmic problem sets, immediate feedback, and performance dashboards that help both students and instructors track progress over time. I often assign **data-driven problems** where students estimate inflation, simulate business cycles, or test statistical hypotheses—reinforcing the connection between theory and application.

Technology is especially powerful for teaching **quantitative reasoning and data literacy**. I guide students through analyzing economic trends using **Excel**, **Stata**, or **FRED datasets**, showing them how to clean data, run regressions, and interpret output. In one capstone project, students modeled the trajectory of the U.S. economy by constructing macroeconomic indicators and forecasting GDP growth—skills they later reported using in internships and research roles.

Beyond tools, I design my courses around the principle of **"learn by doing."** Students debate minimum wage policy by role-playing as small business owners or union representatives; they compete in live-market simulations to find equilibrium prices; and they design regression-based research questions inspired by real labor market trends. These exercises mirror how economists work—posing questions, analyzing data, and communicating findings—and prepare students to contribute meaningfully beyond the classroom.

Ultimately, I aim to cultivate a mindset where students approach problems like economists: with *curiosity, structure, and evidence*. Technology enables me to meet students where they are, personalize their learning journey, and equip them with practical skills they can carry forward. My goal is for students to leave my class not just knowing economics, but *doing* economics—with **confidence, rigor, and creativity**.
