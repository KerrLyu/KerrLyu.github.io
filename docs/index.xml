      <title>Social Capital and Self-employment Dynamics in China</title>

      <description>Abstract Abstract: Opportunity-driven entrepreneurship could stimulate economic growth and foster technology innovation while subsistence-driven self-employment could have the opposite eï¬€ect. In China, a country with a typical relational society, and a middle-income status, the nature of nonagricultural self-employment remains contentious. Examining the influence of social capital on entrepreneurial activities could provide insight into the nature of entrepreneurial activities in China, though this issue has received relatively little attention in the literature. To address this gap, this study employs multivariate discrete choice modeling on national representative samples from the China Family Panel Studies dataset to assess the relationship between social capital and entrepreneurship dynamics.</description>
