      <description>Abstract Abstract: The global energy transition is crucial for all nations due to increasing concerns about energy security and climate change. The low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy is an essential project in the energy transition process, but its impact on urban energy transition (ET) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this, we use a multi-temporal Difference In Difference (DID) model, analyzing panel data from 277 Chinese cities spanning 2006 to 2020, to examine the effects of the LCCP policy on urban energy transition.</description>
